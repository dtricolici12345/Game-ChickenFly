The third hackathon hosted by WildCodeSchool was a thrilling adventure crafted entirely on the Unity platform using the C# language. With just two days at our disposal, I embarked on a solo mission to create an exhilarating game. I named it "ChickenFly," featuring the unstoppable Chicken Terminator overcoming obstacles with gusto.

But that's not all â€“ I didn't stop there. I infused the game with catchy music and the thrill of keeping score as players navigate through challenges. Control is at your fingertips, whether you prefer the spacebar or the mouse click. And let's not forget the dynamic background, synchronized with the chicken's movements, adding another layer of excitement to the gameplay.

This was my maiden voyage into the world of Unity, and I'm proud to say it was a resounding success!
